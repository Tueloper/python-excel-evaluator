Python

This is part of my python learning, using excel to manipulate excel datas and create charts. 
With this respository, i hope to practise more of what python can do with with excel and create a home for python and excel calculations

## How to Use
- clone repo
- `pip install openpyxl`
- start using the application
- incase you want to contribute, please if the excel sheet you will be working on is not in the app, add yours and create a new file to run your application
- also ensure each python file is for an excel sheet
